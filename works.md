My current work centers around proprioception after stroke. Proprioception is our bodies awareness of it's location in space both during movement and when no movement is occuring. This is the sense that allows us to make movements without constantly looking at them take place. Stroke is a neurological injury that can arise from a blockage (ischemic) of blood flow in the brain or the bursting of a blood vesssel (hemmoraghic). Stroke can cause many issues, but the one I focus on is movement impairments. Current theories of movement postulate that the sensory system feeds information to the motor system in both feedforward and feedback loops to create smooth movements^{1}. While movement impairments can be from motor system dysfunction, they can also be from senosry system dysfunction. 

Proprioception is a particuarly challenging sense to study for many reasons, but to be brief a main challenge is that to truly assess, train, or evaluate it, one needs tight control of the environment. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. This tight control of the environment can be achieved very well through robotics. In the [Sensorimotor Control and Robotic Rehabilitation Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/semrau-lab/), we use the [KINARM Exoskeleton](https://kinarm.com/kinarm-products/kinarm-exoskeleton-lab/). 

The main goal of my graduate work is to further develop robotic proprioceptive assessments. I have assisted with projects that invovle proprioceptive training, mutlisensory integration, and validation of tablet based assessments.
