**A. Personal Statement** 

My long term research interests involve the development of a comprehensive understanding of how stroke effects movement and how to retrain movement post stroke. My academic training and research experience to date have provided me with an excellent background in movement science and neuroscience. While in high school I was a member of the National Honor Society, Science National Honor Society, French National Honor Society, and Math Honor Society. As an undergraduate at Denison University, I conducted research with Dr. Brian Hortz on the mechanisms and training of dry needling. This resulted in a co-authorship publication, as well as an invitation to present a poster at the Undergraduate Research Symposium<sup>1,2<\sup>. For my graduate training at University of Delaware, I have moved into the fields of neuroscience and neurorehabilitation by studying the effects of stroke on proprioception, under Dr. Jennifer Semrau. Dr. Semrau is an internationally recognized leader in the field of sensorimotor control, specifically assessing proprioception. Along with giving me new conceptual and technical training, the proposed training plan outlines a set of career development activities and workshops â€“ e.g. public speaking, literature analysis, robot programming, and mentoring options. I have developed most of the projects for my dissertation. These projects range from ameliorating current proprioceptive assessments to novel proprioceptive training paradigms, all using a robotic exoskeleton. Overall, I feel that my choice of sponsor, research project, and the training I will receive will give me a solid foundation for my long-term goal to become an effective scientist and professor.
