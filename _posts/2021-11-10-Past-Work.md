During my undergraduate studies, my research, under the guidance of Dr. Brian Hortz, revolved around dry needling. I began this research the summer of 2018 and concluded it in May 2019. During the summer of 2018, I first began the research by getting familiar with the dry needling literature and many perspectives of the underlying mechanisms. I also deployed a survey about Athletic Trainers current competences regarding dry needling via Qualtrics. This work ultimately led to a successful [publication](https://tulimid1.github.io/research/). During the 2018-2019 academic year I continued this work through more exploration of the verified mechanics of dry needling. 


What is dry needling? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_needling) would define it as "a pseudoscientific technique used by various healthcare practitioners, including physical therapists, physicians, and chiropractors, among others." I would define it as the scientific version of acupuncture. Objectively, dry needling is a technique of using monofilament needles to manipulate cutaneous and subcutaneous structures. As you can see, it's worthiness is currently of hot debate. There are those that believe it has no place among more traditional medicine, and others that believe we need new practices like this and the experiences speak louder than the literature. 

This project truly opened my mind to what research was and what it felt like to be on the border of humanities current knowledge. It was addicting. I loved every aspect about reading experiments and then trying to piece together the full picture. It was fascinating and overwhelming all at the same time. 

Upon reflection of this work, other passions I found at my time at Denison University, and talking with my advisors (Dr. Eric Winters and Dr. Brian Hortz), I came to realization that I wanted to focus on human movement and I enjoyed research and teaching. The manifestation of that realization was graduate school.
