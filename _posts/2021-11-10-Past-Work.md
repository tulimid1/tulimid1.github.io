My work during my undergraduate years revolved around dry needling. I did this work with Dr. Brian Hortz during my junior and senior years. 

During my junior year we focused on athletic trainers education preparation for dry needling. 

During my senior year we focused on the proposed biological mechancism for how dry needling worked.
