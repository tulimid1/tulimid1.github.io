During my undergraduate studies, my research, under the guidance of Dr. Brian Hortz, focused on dry needling. I focused on this for about a year (summer 2018 - May 2019). During the summer of 2018, I first began the research by getting acquainted with the dry needling literature and the many perspectives of the underlying mechanisms. During this time I deployed a survey about Athletic Trainers' current competences regarding dry needling via Qualtrics. This work ultimately led to a successful [publication](https://tulimid1.github.io/research/). During the 2018-2019 academic year I continued this work through more exploration of the verified mechanics of dry needling. 


What is dry needling? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_needling) would define it as "a pseudoscientific technique used by various healthcare practitioners, including physical therapists, physicians, and chiropractors, among others." I would define it as the scientific version of acupuncture. Objectively, dry needling is a technique of using monofilament needles to manipulate cutaneous and subcutaneous structures. As you can see, its worthiness is currently of hot debate in the literature, among clinicians, and with state licensing committees. There are those that believe it has no place among more traditional medicine and others that believe we need new practices like this. 

This project truly opened my mind to what research was and what it felt like to be on the border of current knowledge. It was addicting. I loved every aspect about reading scientific articles and then trying to form a full picture. It was fascinating and overwhelming all at the same time. 

Upon reflection of this work, other passions, and talking with my advisors (Dr. Eric Winters and Dr. Brian Hortz), I came to realization that I wanted to focus on human movement and I enjoyed research and teaching. The pathway to living my passions was graduate school.
