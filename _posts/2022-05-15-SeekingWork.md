I was recently informed by my University that graduate students are allowed to work 9.5 hrs/wk without breaching contract beginning Fall 2022. 
Therefore, I am seeking remote part-time work involving MATLAB and/or Python to analyze and visualize data. I a fluent in both languages and 
very skillful. If interested or know someone who is hiring, please contact me.
