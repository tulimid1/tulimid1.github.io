# Main focus 

My current work focuses on proprioception after stroke. Proprioception is our bodies awareness of it's location in space both during movement and when no movement is occuring. Stroke is a neurological injury from either a blockage of a blood vessel (ischemic) or the bursting of a blood vessel (hemmorhagic).

# Assistive role

I have had assistive roles on many projects ranging from creating an algorithm to generate a random maze to classification of sensory data for pre-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy. 

Maze generation 
- This project was done in colloboration with Makenna Dixon, who was an undergraduate researcher in the lab. 

Sensors-Quantifying Active vs. Sedentary Time During Floor Play in Pre-Ambulatory Children with Cerebral Palsy
- This project was done by Julie Orlando and her colleagues. I simply helped with review and optimization of the code.
