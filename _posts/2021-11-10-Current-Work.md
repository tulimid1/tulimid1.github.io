# Main focus 

My current work focuses on proprioception after stroke. Proprioception is our bodies awareness of it's location in space both during movement and when no movement is occuring. Stroke is a neurological injury from either a blockage of a blood vessel (ischemic) or the bursting of a blood vessel (hemmorhagic).

# Assistive role

I have had assistive roles on projects that explore multisensory integration and reliability of sensory data for pediatrics.
