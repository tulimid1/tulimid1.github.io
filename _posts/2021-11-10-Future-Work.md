I see myself in two worlds. I will be in both of these two worlds eventually, but I am only one person, so I am restrained to one world at a time. 


World 1: I continue working to help improve movement in clinical populations. I work for a company that has the goal of using computer vision to do movement analysis. I create publically-available software and educate users and beneficiaries of this software. I am creating freely available descriptive and analytical software that can be used in synchrony with these more accessible movement analysis methods. I am also working alongside the clinicians and clinical populations I am creating this software for, educating them on how to use it, how to interpret the results, and listening to what would help them the most and what has worked for them.  

Fortunately, with the current state and quality of markerless motion capture systems and computer vision algorithms, I don't think this dream is truly far from a future reality. I'm not sure that I will be able to get paid to make *free* products. Although, never say never. 

World 2: I am a senior data scientist. I work with a team on projects that take roughly a year. I get to learn about how the industry handles problems and the equally beautiful and vicious free market. I analyze projects responsibly with people in mind and write code that a non-programmer could comprehend .
