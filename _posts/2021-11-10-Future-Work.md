I see myself in two worlds. 


World 1: I combine an old passion for human movement with a new passion for writing programs. I continue working to help improve movement in clinical populations. I work for a company that has the goal of using computer vision to do movement analysis. My role in the company is to create publicly-available software to analyze human movement. I am also in charge of educating the users and beneficiaries of this software. The software I create is freely available and aims to describe and analyze movement in a way that is practical and useable by an informed therapist. I am also working alongside these therapists, clinicians, and clinical populations I am creating this software for, educating them on what the results mean and listening to what would help them the most and what has worked for them.  

Fortunately, with the current state and quality of markerless motion capture systems and computer vision algorithms, I don't think this dream is truly far from a future reality. I'm not sure that I will be able to get paid to make *free* products. Although, never say never. 

World 2: I spend most of my working hours in a cold dark room with one plant that was last watered a week ago, hunched over a keyboard cursing quietly to myself asking myself what this error even means. You guessed it; I am a senior data scientist! I get to live out my dream of minimizing human interaction and maximizing dopamine release from writing artistic programs that create elegant models to solve real life problems. While this description may seem grim to some, it seems like an oasis to others. 

I see myself in both worlds in my future. I am not sure which world will come next in my life, but I am open to either one or other possible divergent worlds that may appear out of thin air.
